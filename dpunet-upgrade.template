Summary
-------
The border gateway router (rtr-loc-code-func) is in need of a software
upgrade and line card upgrade.  It is currently running a.bRc.d.  In
order to keep current and move to the version of software recommended by
the vendor, it is advised that we upgrade to Router OS m.nRx.y.  We also
have a new line card that provides faster link interface capability that
we wish to install during this change.  An estimated outage window of 30
minutes is required.


Installation Procedure
----------------------
1.  Login to the router from a console connection.  Start a shell with
    the following command:

    > start shell

2.  The new software has already been copied to foo.bar.baz:/images and
    and to rtr-loc-code-func:/var/tmp.  Verify the current software on
    the device is the one you expect.  The md5 and sha1 output by the
    following commands should match the md5 and sha1 hashes listed for
    this code release above:

    % md5 /var/tmp/package-m.nRx.y-train.tgz
    % sha1 /var/tmp/package-m.nRx.y-train.tgz

4.  Verify that the back-out software exists and matches the md5 hash
    listed above:

    % md5 /var/tmp/package-a.bRc.d-train.tgz
    % sha1 /var/tmp/package-a.bRc.d-train.tgz

5.  Exit from the shell.  Then from the CLI, ensure no one else is
    logged into the router and making changes:

    % exit
    > show system users

6.  If configuration changes have been made in the last 7 days,
    skip this step.  Otherwise, create a rescue configuration based
    on the current, running and presumably stable configuration:

    > request system configuration rescue save
 
7.  Take down the internal and external BGP sessions so that Internet
    traffic will be rerouted over alternate paths during the maintenance
    window.  This will help minimize traffic/route flapping, packet
    loss, and errant usage patterns.

    # deactivate protocols bgp
    # commit confirm    

8.  Run the upgrade commands (there are only two commands shown below,
    the second command is wrapped in this document in order to be more
    easily printed/read):

    > request system snapshot
    > request system software add validate reboot
        /var/tmp/package-a.bRc.d-train.tgz

9.  Power down the router and install the line card in the [XXX] slot
    then restart the router.

10. Review the configuration and note any discrepancies or deprecated
    configuration statements.  Validate that the system is operating
    properly by verifying routes, connectivity, management tools, and
    network measurement statistics showing all status as normal.  Make
    any necessary config changes as detailed below in the "Technical
    Notes" section.

11. Reactivate the BGP sessions once the changes have been successfully
    deployed.

    # activate protocols bgp
    # commit confirm


Back-out Procedures
-------------------
1.  From the Router OS CLI, run the following commands (command shown is
    all one line, it is wrapped in this document in order to be more
    easily printed/read):

    > request system software add validate reboot
       /var/tmp/package-a.bRc.d-train.tgz

2.  Power down the router and remove the line card if necessary.


Summary of Relevant Code Issues, Fixes and Features of m.nRx.y
----------------------------------------------------------------------
.------- minor (.), major (-) or critical (!) issue
|.------ upgrade fixes (*), upgrade doesn't fix ($)
||.----- configuration change or new feature (+)
|||
vvv
-*+  New fancy dandy line card (Model No. AB-EFG-10G) support
.*+  RADIUS functionality over IPv6 support
.*+  ICMP and ICMPv6 generation rate is configurable
.*+  Firewall filter can prevent or allow datagram fragmentation
.*+  Support for BMPv3
.*+  show version output changed to show consistent system version
.*   show route command might have led to rpd crash (PR/12345)
.*   various NTP related vulnerabilities patched (PR/99999)
.$   License check may consume high CPU (PR/929292)


Technical Notes
---------------
Remove unnecessary IP multicast related configuration statements:

  # delete routing-options rib inet.2
  # delete protocols msdp
  # delete protocols pim

We should plan on performing an upgrade after the Spring 1972 quarter
if possible.  Release m.n will reach end of support on July 1, 1972.
 
Useful commands to use to review connectivity before and after the
upgrade:

  show bgp summary
  show chassis alarms
  show chassis environment
  show chassis feb
  show chassis routing-engine
  show interfaces brief
  show msdp
  show ospf neighbor
  show pim neighbors
  show route summary
  show version
